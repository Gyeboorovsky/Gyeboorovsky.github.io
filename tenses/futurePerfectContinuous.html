            <p>For negative sentences in the Future Perfect Continuous tense, we insert not 
                between will and have. For question sentences, we exchange the subject and will.

            <h3>How do we use the Future Perfect Continuous Tense?</h3>
            <p>The Future Perfect Continuous tense is like the Future Perfect tense, 
                but it expresses longer actions or states extending up to some specific 
                event or time in the future. For example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Ram starts waiting at 9am. I am late and cannot arrive before 10am. Ram will have been waiting for an hour by the time I meet him.</li>
                <li>He'll be tired when he gets here. He'll have been travelling all day.</li>
                <li>How long will Jo have been working when he retires?</li>
                <li>Next month I'll have been studying Chinese for two years.</li>
                <li>Will you have been working when I arrive?</li>
                <li>He won't have been studying long enough to qualify.</li>
                <li>Next week Jane is going to swim from England to France. By the time she gets to France she'll have been swimming non-stop for over thirteen hours.</li>
            </ul>
