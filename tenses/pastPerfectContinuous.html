            <h1>Past Perfect Continuous</h1>
            <p>The Past Perfect Continuous is another tense that expresses the "past in the past".</p>
            <h3>How do we make the Past Perfect Continuous tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>The structure of the Past Perfect Continuous tense is:</strong></p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>subject</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary have</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary be</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>main verb</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>conjugated in Past Simple</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>past participle</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>had</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>been</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>present participle</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The first auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Past Simple, invariable: had</p>
            <p>The second auxiliary verb (be) is invariable in past participle form: been</p>
            <p>The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing</p>
            <p>For negative sentences we insert not after the first auxiliary verb.</p>
            <p>For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the first auxiliary verb.</p>
