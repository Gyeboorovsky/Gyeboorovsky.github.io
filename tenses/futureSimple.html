            <h1>Future Simple</h1>
            <p>The Future Simple tense is often called the "will tense" because we make the Future Simple with the modal auxiliary will.</p>
            <h3>How do we make the Future Simple tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>The structure of the Future Simple tense is:</strong></p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>subject</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary will</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>main verb</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>invariable</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>base</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>will</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>V1</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            
            <p>For negative sentences in the Future Simple tense, we insert not between the auxiliary verb and main verb. For question 
                sentences, we exchange the subject and auxiliary verb.</p>

            <h3>Contraction with Future Simple</h3>

            <p>When we use the Future Simple tense in speaking, we often contract the subject and auxiliary verb:</p>
            
            <table class="ec-table">
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>I will</td>
                        <td>I'll</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>you will</td>
                        <td>you'll</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>he will<br>

                        <td>he'll<br>
                        she'll<br>
                        it'll</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>we will</td>
                        <td>we'll</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>they will</td>
                        <td>they'll</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>In negative sentences, we contract with won't, like this:</p>

                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>I will not</td>
                        <td>I won't</td>
                    </tr>

                        <td>he will not<br>
                        she will not<br>
                        it will not</td>
                        <td>he won't<br>
                        she won't<br>
                        it won't</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>we will not</td>
                        <td>we won't</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>they will not</td>
                        <td>they won't</td>

            <h3>How do we use the Future Simple tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>No Plan</strong></p>
            <p>We use the Future Simple tense when there is no plan or decision to do something
                 before we speak. We make the decision spontaneously at the time of speaking. 
                 Look at these examples:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Hold on. I'll get a pen.</li>
                <li>We will see what we can do to help you.</li>
                <li>Maybe we'll stay in and watch television tonight.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In these examples, we had no firm plan before speaking. The decision is made at the time of speaking.</p>
            <p>We often use the Future Simple tense with the verb to think before it:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I think I'll go to the gym tomorrow.</li>
                <li>I think I will have a holiday next year.</li>
                <li>I don't think I'll buy that car.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Prediction</strong></p>
            <p>We often use the Future Simple tense to make a prediction about the future. Again, there is no firm plan. 
                We are saying what we think will happen. Here are some examples:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>It will rain tomorrow.</li>
                <li>People won't go to Jupiter before the 22nd century.</li>
                <li>Who do you think will get the job?</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Be</strong></p>
            <p>When the main verb is be, we can use the Future Simple tense even if we have a firm plan or decision before speaking. Examples:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>I'll be in London tomorrow.</li>
                <li>I'm going shopping. I won't be very long.</li>
                <li>Will you be at work tomorrow?</li>
            </ul>
