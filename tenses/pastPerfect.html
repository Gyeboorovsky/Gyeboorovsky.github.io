            <h1>Past Perfect</h1>
            <p>The Past Perfect tense is quite an easy tense to understand and to use. This tense talks about the "past in the past".</p>
            <p>In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Past Perfect tense, followed by a quiz to check your understanding.</p>
            <h3>How do we make the Past Perfect tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>The structure of the Past Perfect tense is:</strong></p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>subject</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary have</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>main verb</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>conjugated in Past Simple</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>had</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>participle</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Past Simple: had</p>
            <p>The main verb is invariable in past participle form: -ed (or irregular)</p>
            <p>For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</p>
            <p>For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.</p>
            <p><strong>Look at these example sentences with the Past Perfect tense:</strong></p>

            <table>

            <h3>Contraction with Past Perfect</h3>
            <p>When we use the Past Perfect in speaking, we often contract the subject and the auxiliary verb. 
                We also sometimes do this in informal writing:
            </p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>I had</td>
                        <td>I'd</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>you had</td>
                        <td>you'd</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>he had<br>
                        she had<br>
                        it had</td>
                        <td>he'd<br>
                        she'd<br>
                        it'd</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>we had</td>
                        <td>we'd</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>they had</td>
                        <td>they'd</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>How do we use the Past Perfect tense?</h3>
            <p>The Past Perfect tense expresses action in the past before another action in the past. 
                This is the past in the past. For example:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>I wasn't hungry. I had just eaten.</li>
                <li>They were hungry. They had not eaten for five hours.</li>
                <li>I didn't know who he was. I had never seen him before.</li>
                <li>"Mary wasn't at home when I arrived." / "Really? Where had she gone?"</li>
                <li>He told us that the train had left.</li>
                <li>I thought I had met her before, but I was wrong.</li>
                <li>He explained that he had closed the window because of the rain.</li>
                <li>I wondered if I had been there before.</li>
                <li>I asked them why they had not finished.</li>
            </ul>
