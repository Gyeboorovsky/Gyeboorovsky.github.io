            <h1>Present Perfect</h1>
            <p>The Present Perfect tense is a rather important tense in English, but it gives speakers of some languages 
                a difficult time. That is because it uses concepts or ideas that do not exist in those languages. 
                In fact, the structure of the Present Perfect is very simple. The problems come with the use of the tense. 
                In addition, there are some differences in usage between British and American English.
            </p>
            <p>In this lesson we look at the structure and use of the Present Perfect tense, as well as 
                the use of for and since, followed by a quiz to check your understanding.
            </p>

            <h3>How do we make the Present Perfect tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>The structure of the Present Perfect is:</strong></p>

            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>subject</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary have</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>main verb</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>conjugated in Present Simple</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>have, has</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>past participle</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The auxiliary verb (have) is conjugated in the Present Simple: have, has</p>
            <p>The main verb is invariable in past participle form: -ed (or irregular)</p>
            <p>For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</p>
            <p>For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.</p>
