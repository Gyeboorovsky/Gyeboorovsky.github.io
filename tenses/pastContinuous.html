            <h1>Past Continuous</h1>
            <p>The Past Continuous tense is an important tense in English.</p>
            <p>We use it to say what we were in the middle of doing at a particular moment in the past.</p>
            <h3>How do we make the Past Continuous tense?</h3>
            <p><strong>The structure of the past continuous tense is:</strong></p>
            
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>subject</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>auxiliary be</td>
                        <td>+</td>
                        <td>main verb</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>conjugated in Past Simple</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>was, were</td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td>present participle</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The auxiliary verb (be) is conjugated in the Past Simple: was, were</p>
            <p>The main verb is invariable in present participle form: -ing</p>
            <p>For negative sentences we insert not between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</p>
            <p>For question sentences, we exchange the subject and the auxiliary verb.</p>
            <p><strong>Look at these example sentences with the Past Continuous tense:</strong></p>

            <h3>How do we use the Past Continuous tense?</h3>
            <p>The Past Continuous tense expresses action at a particular moment in the past. The action started before that moment but 
                has not finished at that moment. For example, yesterday I watched a film on TV. The film started at 7pm and finished at 9pm.
            </p>
            <p>When we use the Past Continuous tense, our listener usually knows or understands what time we are talking about.</p>
            <p><strong>Look at these examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>I was working at 10pm last night.</li>
                <li>They were not playing football at 9am this morning.</li>
                <li>What were you doing at 10pm last night?</li>
                <li>What were you doing when he arrived?</li>
                <li>She was cooking when I telephoned her.</li>
                <li>We were having dinner when it started to rain.</li>
                <li>Ram went home early because it was snowing.</li>
            </ul>
